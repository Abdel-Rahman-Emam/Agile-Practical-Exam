# The Near Vision
   For the first sprint, we should have at least a functioning dev character model with very basic animations.
  
   For the second sprint, we hope to have a mini-map to be able to walk around it.

# The Story Point Estimation Convention Used
  For this software it has been decided to go for the fibonacci sequence story point estimation convention, which means the a story point can be assigned an estimate of the       following numbers: 1,2,3,5,8,13,20,40,60,80,100
  
# Ordering Rationale
   Since the ordering of the backlog is not essentially or rather rarely priotrized based on the return on interest of a PBI, as a team we decided we'd rather order the backlog
   based on the importance of the backlog item in comparison to the core objective of the gameplay.
 
 
 # Story Points Estimate per Sprint
   Since we have a relatively large team, it was decided that 40 story points is good achievable metric per our sprint duration (4 weeks), thats also due to the fact that we
   have about 5-6 stories per sprint.
